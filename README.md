MVP
---
1. Users should be able to create an account.
2. Users should be able to browse data sets (from Quandl) by geographic location.
3. Users should be able to save and view a geographic location to view from profile page.
4. Users should be able to change and update saved geographic locations being tracked on profile page.
5. Each Geographic Location in the profile view will show statistical data from Quandl.


Stretch Goals
-------------
1. Drag and Drop customizable profile views.
2. Use d3 or Angular for data visualization.
3. Use user's geographic location to set default location.


Planning Thoughts
-----------------

 - Which data sets from Quandl will I be using?
 - How specific in geographic location for the data sets?
 - What sort of data visualizations would be easiest/most appropriate?
